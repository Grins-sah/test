## Dynamic Programming
1. it is an optimised Recursion
2. removal of overlapping subproblem 
3. save us from re-Calculation
4. use to optimise brute froce solution
5. eg :- fibonacci number
6. Recursion + Memorization => (TOP DOWN DP)
7. Tabulation => (Bottom UP DP)
8. state of the dp is the parameter on which the subProblem repeats
9. dp is two types 1.Combination that is counting problem
10. second minMax problem
